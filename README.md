# Data-Augmentation-for-Object-Detection


This code performs data augmentation for object detection tasks, handling bounding boxes for the augmented images effectively. The augmentations included are:

- Horizontal Flip
- Vertical Flip
- Rotation

## How to Use

1. **Specify folder paths:**
   - Image folder path
   - Labels folder path
   - Save directory on your drive

2. **Run the code:** The script will process the images and save the augmented versions with adjusted bounding boxes.

Feel free to edit the code based on your needs.
